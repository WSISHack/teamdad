Saga: Bridging the Gap Between Folklore and Fact

A child first learns the difference between right and wrong from their family. Some of the earliest moments when we begin to learn about right and wrong is through stories, through fairy tales and folktales. The problem with folklore is that it doesn’t always embody our values. Children also often reject these stories in favor of more engaging media - videos, games or animations

We want to reinvent storytelling by bridging the gap between folklore and fact. That means that we want to crowdsource fairy tales from local communities around the world. And through an online network of teachers, scientists, and students, reimagine those stories as lessons for future generations through interactive media, such as games, online storybooks and cartoons. In this way, when a grandparent sits down with their grandchild to read them a story, they won’t be reinforcing unhealthy eating habits or harmful stereotypes.

SAGA aims to preserve a local community’s cultural heritage while letting children be co-creators in storytelling. By turning folk characters into modern day heroes, we are enabling children to reconnect with their roots. We’ve made the platform as a web application, so it’s easy to scale from community to community. That means we want to engage the community from the grassroots, by working with schools, community organizations, museums, and libraries to raise awareness and promote adoption. We also recognize that people with a range of different technical experience will want to share their stories so we’ve made the user interface simple, accessible and easy to use for everyone whether you're old or young, a tech novice or expert.

We believe Saga will enable families to keep a foot in the past while looking to the future.
